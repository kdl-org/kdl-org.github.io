KDL is a document language with xml-like semantics that looks like you're
invoking a bunch of CLI commands! It's meant to be used both as a
serialization format and a configuration language, much like JSON, YAML, or
XML.

There's a living [specification](https://github.com/kdl-org/kdl/blob/main/SPEC.md), as well as various
[implementations](#implementations). You can also check out the [FAQ](#faq) to
answer all your burning questions!

In addition to a spec for KDL itself, there are also standard specs for [a KDL
Query Language](https://github.com/kdl-org/kdl/blob/main/QUERY-SPEC.md) based
on CSS selectors, and [a KDL Schema
Language](https://github.com/kdl-org/kdl/blob/main/SCHEMA-SPEC.md) loosely
based on JSON Schema.

The language is based on [SDLang](https://sdlang.org), with a number of
modifications and clarifications on its syntax and behavior.

The current version of the KDL spec is `1.0.0`.
